# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

I am tasked to utilize my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and provide a supporting visual graph of total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources

  * Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
  * Software: Python 3.9.12, Anaconda Navigator 2.2.0, conda 4.13.0, Jupyter Lab 3.3.2

## Results

At first glance at the Pyber Data Summary it is clear that there is a big difference in three city types. Urban area received more rides then the other two combined (Total Rides). Giving the area the highest revenue(Total Fares). But yet Urban drivers were paid the less (Average Fare per Driver).

The graph below shows the fare differences between the areas of service: Rural, Urban, and Suburban areas.The greatest gap is between rural and urban city types. Urban having the most riders. From the data you can see that between late Febuary and March business seems to pick up. The up tick is not felt in all three areas for the whole month of March but it is felt. Even then the Rural area out performs.

## Summary

From the data we are able to see that there is a demand for this service in all three city types. A major concern when looking at the data is the number of driver compared to the number of rides in the Urban city types they are over saturation. There is not enough demand in that area to sustain that amount of drivers. I have some great recommendation that Pyber can implemnt below.


## Recommendations

  * By Decreasing the Drivers by at least 50% will balance the driver/ride ratio. This should drive up Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver.

  * In urban cities switching to a per mile charge base, for shorter trips.

  * Partner with local business, restaurants, hotels, to grow the demand.

  * Offer promotions, and discounts fares during low fare seasons to boost demand.
